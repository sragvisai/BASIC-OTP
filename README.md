# BASIC-OTP

This project uses the text-belt otp apt to send and verfiy the otp sent to a user's valid phone number.
**It is a paid version with a limit of 50 messages**.

How to launch the project?
  1. In the server folder run the following command : npm run start
  2. Now you can open the index.html using any of the web browsers.( Verified the behavior in Google Chrome)
  3. Enter a valid phone number (Valid phone numbers have an extensions +1)
  4. Enter the received otp and you will be navigated to a different page.
  5. After 3 unsuccessful attempts a failure page will be loaded.
 
 **Future Work :** 
  1. Feasible navigation between the pages. For example : After the failure page, providing an option to go back to the login page.
  2. Styling
  3. More validations to the phone number.
